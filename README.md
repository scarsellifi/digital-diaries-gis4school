# The Digital Diaries

The Digital Diaries tool has been designed and
developed as a cornerstone of the strategy of monitoring
and intervention in the project [GIS4SCHOOL](https://gis4schools.eu/#/home).

It is a fast, not expensive, and scalable tool based on open-source
digital technology that provides valuable information for:

• Real-time monitoring: for timely intervention
and a more in-depth long-term assessment.
• Thematic monitoring: to obtain a general
overview of the progress of the project and the
detail of a single problem.

It can be adapted and improved over time as an opensource tool, adding elements to enhance and introduce
new functionalities and multiplying its reuse even on
new projects.

## How the Digital Diaries tool work?

The idea behind the Digital Diaries is that all
the participants in the project must keep a "standard
diary" where they can anonymously collect and share
their impressions and progress with the evaluation
group throughout the project's progresses through the
compilation of diary pages.

Being digital, the diary allows the evaluation
team to collect feedback and send inputs to and from the
interested parties in real-time through a specific
encrypted communication between the dedicated
information system and the smartphone device
(notifications) of the participants where they can display
and interact with the digital diary.

The subject can send impressions about the
project as voluntary feedback- so called “open diary
page”- or as answers to precise questions-structured
diary pages- sent by the research group in a planned,
automated, and standardized way through direct
messages to the compilation.

The system simplifies the relationship between
the subject examined and the survey group, allowing
management in parallel on several groups that may have
carried out activities at a different stage of progress,
maintaining a high degree of comparability between the
responses.

### The digital diaries tool is composed of two

main elements:

1. A smartphone application to be installed by the
   project participants. The protocol used by the opensource software is also adaptable to third-party
   applications. In the case of the GIS4Schools project, it
   was agreed on using the Telegram application as a
   client, which guaranteed the highest level of security
   and extreme ease of installation and compatibility with a
   wide range of devices.

2. A scalable application (serverless). It manages the
   entire communication path (sending diary pages /
   receiving responses), the analysis of compiled diaries,
   and two types of reporting:

• a dashboard for the staff to show the evolution
of the main project indicators.

• a dashboard for participants to self-assess their
path within the project and check the progress
of the group they belong to.
